# this varible holds the number 1

number = 1

# we ask whether the value of number is less than or equal to 10 and keep going if that is the case (if the value of the number is over 10, we stop)
while number <= 10:

    # print the value of number
    print(number)
    # add 1 to the value of number and assign that result to number
    number = number + 1
